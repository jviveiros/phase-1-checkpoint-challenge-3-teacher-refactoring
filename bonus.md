# Super Crazy Bonus Release

Edit this file to answer the following questions. Give examples. You may need to do a bit of research. :)

1. Why is Hash.fetch useful? It's particularly useful to set a default value when you are unable to fetch the data you are looking for. It's especially important to do when a boolean (false) value may be returned.

2. What is the disadvantage of single inheritance, and what's a possible solution to that problem? I would imagine the disadvantage of single inheritance is that it limits the amount of methods that can be called from the parent class.

3. Why are these classes initialized with an options hash? They are initialized with an options hash because they can take the data in any order vs having to be exactly in the order of age phase name, etc.

4. What is the purpose of the private keyword in a class? What does it protect you from and why is that valuable? The private keyword is generally to identify less stable code that should generally be avoided for reuse.

5. Why are concepts like encapsulation, single responsibility, and abstraction important? Now that you've been programming for a while, have you seen any advantages for yourself, or can you imagine them in the future? I think the advantages directly tie to the ability to reuse the code in an efficient manner, extract pieces without breaking it and generally provide a more robust and less of a tangled mess of code.
